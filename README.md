# TODO

Todo is a simple little app. It's based on create-react-app and chakra-ui

## Setup

To run this project you must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.

To get started, run these commands:

```
npm install
npm test
```

## Feature One

Each task has a point value associated with it. This represents how important it is to us. The task list should always be shown with the most important tasks at the top of the list.

## Feature Two

We want to make it obvious at a glance which tasks are the really crucial ones. Any task that has a point value 10 or above should look like a 'critical' task. Any other task should look 'normal'.

## Feature Three

Our users are keen to be able to add point values to tasks with a natural language style input. When a user inputs a task name they should be able to, for example, enter 'do stuff 10pts' and have a task added with 10 points.

## Feature Four

If you've got some extra time left, it would be great for our users to be able to update the point value of an existing task. Implement the UI however you think best.
